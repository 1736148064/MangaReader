## attention of developer

react-native-reanimated@v2 can't use remote debug, the version higher than v2.3.1 useless in iOS simulator when remote debug is on, see detail on this [doc](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/#known-problems-and-limitations), and issues on github

- [If expo react native debugger open, swipe doesn't respond in IOS](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/issues/1302)
- [app crashes if debugging mode is enabled](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/issues/1674)

so we need to use [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) instead of remote debug
